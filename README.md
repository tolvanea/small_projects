# small_projects
Random one-file self-contained codes that don't deserve own repo.

## hamming.py
Miniman working example of Hamming error correction. It can fix one bit flip errors and it can alert (but not fix) two bit flip erros. It is mathematically optimal solution for single bit flip errors. But most importantly it is damn simple and beautiful algorithm! For elegant and intuitive description, see [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3NxrZOu_CE).

## wavelets.py
Minimal working example of image compression with wavelet decomposotion. Unlike Fourier thansform, wavelets preserve locality both in spatial and frequency domains. That is, wavelets are mathematically rigorous version of spectrogram. The algorithm is home brew, and it is _very_ basic. It basically drops out the weakest 85% of local frequencies. While only the 15% of the wavelets are preserved, it is no where near packing the image to 15% of the original size due to sloppy bit packing.

## laplace_noise.py
Generates cloud-like noise texture using deconvolution of Laplace kernel. This is an interesting phenomenon, as Laplace kernel is almost like a sharpen-kernel, but it normalizes to 0 instead of 1. So we get cloud texture by inversely applying edge detection. What? Why? By intuition I would have predicted that somewhat de-sharpening results somewhat blurring. By the way, this is highly inefficient way to generate cloud texture, as it uses linear equation solver, which has complexity of O(nÂ³), where n is number of pixels in the whole image.

## quines
Quine is a program that prints its source code, without reading it from the source-file. It is a nice challenge/puzzle, as one must use some tricks to make source code match the printed output. The `quines`-directory contains few Rust and Python implementations that I have written from scratch over the years.
